/*
 * The lexical analyzer takes a raw string as its input and will convert it into a
 * sequence of lexical tokens. These tokes are strings with an assigned and and
 * identified value. The parser will use these tokens to later create the parse tree.
 *
 * For the lexemn string expression
 *  "x:=1*2;",
 * the lexer will have to generate a structure of tokens similar to the following:
 *   (lexeme,   token name)
 *   ("x",      <identifier>)
 *   ("1",      <literal>)
 *   ("*",      <operator>)
 *   ("2",      <literal>)
 *   (";",      <separator>)
